[Virgil Security](https://virgilsecurity.com) provides a set of APIs for adding security to any application. In a few simple steps you can encrypt communication, securely store data, provide passwordless login, and ensure data integrity.

For a full overview head over to our .NET/C# [Get Started][_getstarted] guides.

## Installation

The Virgil .NET SDK is provided as a package named *Virgil.SDK*. The package is distributed via NuGet package management system. 

The package is available for .NET Framework 4.5 and newer.

Installing the package

1. Use NuGet Package Manager (Tools -> Library Package Manager -> Package Manager Console)
2. Run `PM> Install-Package Virgil.SDK`

__Next:__ [Get Started with the .NET/C# SDK][_getstarted].

## Encryption Example

Virgil Security makes it super easy to add encryption to any application. With our SDK you create a public [__Virgil Card__][_guide_virgil_cards] for every one of your users and devices. With these in place you can easily encrypt any data in the client.

```csharp
// find Alice's card(s)
var aliceCards = await virgil.Cards.FindAsync("alice");

// encrypt the message using Alice's cards
var message = "Hello Alice!";
var encryptedMessage = aliceCards.Encrypt(message);

// transmit the message with your preferred technology
this.TransmitMessage(encryptedMessage.ToString(StringEncoding.Base64));
```

The receiving user then uses their stored __private key__ to decrypt the message.


```csharp
// load Alice's Key from storage.
var aliceKey = virgil.Keys.Load("alice_key_1", "mypassword");

// decrypt the message using the key 
var originalMessage = aliceKey.Decrypt(transferData).ToString();
```

__Next:__ To [get you properly started][_guide_encryption] you'll need to know how to create and store Virgil Cards. Our [Get Started guide][_guide_encryption] will get you there all the way.

__Also:__ [Encrypted communication][_getstarted_encryption] is just one of the few things our SDK can do. Have a look at our guides on  [Encrypted Storage][_getstarted_storage], [Data Integrity][_getstarted_data_integrity] and [Passwordless Login][_getstarted_passwordless_login] for more information.

## Initialization

To use this SDK you need to [sign up for an account](https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/account/signup) and create your first __application__. Make sure to save the __app id__, __private key__ and it's __password__. After this, create an __application token__ for your application to make authenticated requests from your clients.

To initialize the SDK on the client side you will only need the __access token__ you created.

```csharp
var virgil = new VirgilApi("[ACCESS_TOKEN]");
```

> __Note:__ this client will have limited capabilities. For example, it will be able to generate new __Cards__ but it will need a server-side client to transmit these to Virgil.

To initialize the SDK on the server side we will need the __access token__, __app id__ and the __App Key__ you created on the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/).

```csharp
var context = new VirgilApiContext
{
    AccessToken = "[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE]",
    Credentials = new AppCredentials
    {
        AppId = "[YOUR_APP_ID_HERE]",
        AppKeyData = VirgilBuffer.FromFile("[YOUR_APP_KEY_PATH_HERE]"),
        AppKeyPassword = "[YOUR_APP_KEY_PASSWORD_HERE]"
    }
};

var virgil = new VirgilApi(context);
```
