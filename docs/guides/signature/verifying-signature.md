# Verifying Signature

This guide is a short tutorial on how to verify a **Digital Signature** with Virgil Security.

Set up your project environment before starting to verify a Digital Signature, with the [getting started](/docs/guides/configuration/client-configuration.md) guide.

The Signature Verification procedure is shown in the figure below.

In order to verify the Digital Signature, Bob has to have Alice's Virgil Card.

Let's review the Digital Signature verification process:

- Developers initialize the **Virgil SDK**:

```cs
var virgil = new VirgilApi("[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE]");
```

- Bob takes Alice's **Virgil Card ID** and searches for Alice's Virgil Card on Virgil Services.
- Bob verifies the signature. If the signature is invalid, Bob receives an error message.

```cs
// search for Virgil Card
var aliceCard = await virgil.Cards.Get("[ALICE_CARD_ID_HERE]");
```

See our guide on [Validating Cards](/docs/guides/virgil-card/validating-card.md) for best practices.
