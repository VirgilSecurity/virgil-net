# Encrypting Data

This guide is a short tutorial on how to **encrypt** data with Virgil Security. You will encrypt data using a Public Key, which is saved on the user's Virgil Card. Once encrypted, only the owner of the related Private Key will be able to decrypt the encrypted data. Therefore, you need to search for a user's Virgil Cards at Virgil Services and then encrypt the data using appropriate Virgil Card.

Encryption can be used to provide high levels of security to network communications, e-mails, files stored on the cloud, and other information that requires protection.

Before you begin to encrypt data, set up your project environment using [getting started](/docs/guides/configuration/client-configuration.md) guide.

The Data Encryption procedure is shown in the figure below.

In order to encrypt a **message**, Alice has to have:
 â€“ Bob's Virgil Cards, which should be published on Virgil Services.

Remember that Bob can have a Global Virgil Card as well as an Application Virgil Card. If Alice is not a user of specific Application, she will only be able to find Bob's Global Virgil Cards.

Let's review the data encryption process:

1. Developers need to initialize the **Virgil SDK**

```cs
var virgil = new VirgilApi("[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE]");
```

2. Then Alice:

  -  Searches for Bob's Virgil Card on Virgil Services
  -  Prepares the message for Bob
  -  Encrypts the message for Bob

  ```cs
  // search for Virgil Cards
  var bobCards = await virgil.Cards.FindAsync("bob");

  var message = "Hey Bob, how's it going?";

  // encrypt the message using found Virgil Cards
  var ciphertext = bobCards.Encrypt(message).ToString(StringEncoding.Base64);
  ```

Alice can now send the encrypted message to Bob.
